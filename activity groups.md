> “What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.” - **Kurt Vonnegut**

Activity Groups are designed precisely for this purpose. By emulating SIAM's model for building communities at the University level, we seek to bring together like-minded individuals in Munich to help each other and grow together. Activity Groups are also meant for cross-pollinating ideas across different scientific disciplines. So we strongly encourage future memebers to register for atleast two different activity groups that you might be interested in.

# SIAM's Activity Groups
The activity groups in SIAM's repertoire are the following.\

# Additional Groups
Backed by latest trends, we also introduce activity groups for the following disciplines.
- Network Science
- Theory of Deep Learning

# Coordinators
If you are someone pursuing research in one of these disciplines or are already a SIAM memeber of these activity groups, we encourage you to volunteer to moderate the local activity group (LAG).
